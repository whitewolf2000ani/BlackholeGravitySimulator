# Blackhole Gravity Simulator

Welcome to the Blackhole Gravity Simulator, an interactive gravitational slingshot simulation created using Pygame!

## Overview

This project simulates the fascinating phenomenon of gravitational slingshot around a black hole. Users can experience the powerful effects of gravity on objects as they navigate near a massive celestial body.

## Features

- **Real-time Simulation**: Watch objects bend their trajectories due to the intense gravitational pull of a black hole.
- **Interactive Environment**: Control objects and observe how their paths change based on velocity and proximity to the black hole.
- **Visual Representation**: Experience a visually appealing representation of gravitational physics in action.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/whitewolf2000ani/BlackholeGravitySimulator.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd BlackholeGravitySimulator

3. Install the required dependencies:

pip install pygame

4. Run the simulation:

python main.py


## How to Use

- Launch the application to start the simulation.
- Use your mouse or keyboard (specify controls) to interact with objects in the simulation.
- Observe how objects behave as they approach the black hole's gravitational field.
