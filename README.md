Blackhole Gravity Simulator
Welcome to the Blackhole Gravity Simulator, an interactive gravitational slingshot simulation created using Pygame!
Overview
This project simulates the fascinating phenomenon of gravitational slingshot around a black hole. Users can experience the powerful effects of gravity on objects as they navigate near a massive celestial body.
Features
Real-time Simulation: Watch objects bend their trajectories due to the intense gravitational pull of a black hole.
Interactive Environment: Control objects and observe how their paths change based on velocity and proximity to the black hole.
Visual Representation: Experience a visually appealing representation of gravitational physics in action.
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
git clone https://github.com/whitewolf2000ani/BlackholeGravitySimulator.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
cd BlackholeGravitySimulator
Install the required dependencies:
bash
pip install pygame
Run the simulation:
bash
python main.py
How to Use
Launch the application to start the simulation.
Use your mouse or keyboard (specify controls) to interact with objects in the simulation.
Observe how objects behave as they approach the black hole's gravitational field.
